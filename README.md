# Define

A CLI for finding the definition of a word.

## Requirements

You'll need to get an API key for the [Lingua Robot
API](https://rapidapi.com/rokish/api/lingua-robot/endpoints). That needs to be
in your environment variable as `LINGUA_ROBOT_API_KEY`.

## Installing

I actually don't know lol. Just compile `define.go`, and you'll have a dotfile
that is called `define`. Add that to your `$PATH`? More on this later.

## Random thoughts

I really just wanted to learn Go, and build something that was kind-of useful
for me. If you have any feedback, please open a PR and explain what the
improvement is. That should help me learn Go.
